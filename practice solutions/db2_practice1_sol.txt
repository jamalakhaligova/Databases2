Give the SELECT statements and the results for the following queries.

Database objects
----------------
(DBA_OBJECTS)

1.
Who is the owner of the view DBA_TABLES? Who is the owner of table DUAL?
2.
Who is the owner of synonym DBA_TABLES? (or DUAL)
3.
What kind of objects the database user ORAUSER has? (dba_objects.object_type column)
 SELECT distinct object_type FROM dba_objects
 WHERE owner='ORAUSER';
4.
What are the object types existing in the database?
 SELECT distinct object_type FROM dba_objects;
5.
Which users have more than 10 different kind of objects in the database?
6.
Which users have both triggers and views in the database?
7.
Which users have views but don't have triggers?
 SELECT distinct owner FROM dba_objects WHERE object_type='VIEW'
  MINUS
 SELECT distinct owner FROM dba_objects WHERE object_type='TRIGGER';
8.
Which users have more than 40 tables, but less than 30 indexes?
 SELECT distinct owner FROM dba_objects WHERE object_type='TABLE'
 GROUP BY owner
 HAVING count(*) > 40
  MINUS
 SELECT distinct owner FROM dba_objects WHERE object_type='INDEX'
 GROUP BY owner
 HAVING count(*) >= 30;
9.
Let's see the difference between a table and a view (dba_objects.data_object_id).
 A Table needs storage, a View doesn't need. Only the definition is stored in data dictionary.
10.
Which object types have NULL (or 0) in the column data_object_id?
11.
Which object types have non NULL (and non 0) in the column data_object_id?
12.
What is the intersection of the previous 2 queries?



Columns of a table
------------------
(DBA_TAB_COLUMNS)
13.
How many columns the nikovits.emp table has?
14.
What is the data type of the 6th column of nikovits.emp's table?
15.
Give the owner and name of the tables which have column name beginning with letter 'Z'.
16.
Give the owner and name of the tables which have at least 8 columns with data type DATE.
 SELECT owner, table_name FROM dba_tab_columns
 WHERE data_type='DATE'
 GROUP BY owner, table_name
 HAVING count(*) >= 8;
17.
Give the owner and name of the tables whose 1st and 4th column's datatype is VARCHAR2.
 SELECT owner, table_name FROM dba_tab_columns
 WHERE column_id=1 AND data_type='VARCHAR2'
  INTERSECT
 SELECT owner, table_name FROM dba_tab_columns
 WHERE column_id=4 AND data_type='VARCHAR2';


Write a PL/SQL procedure, which prints out the owners and names of the tables beginning with the 
parameter character string. 
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE table_print(p_char VARCHAR2) IS
...
set serveroutput on
execute table_print('V'); (you can use execute or call)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Help:
-- Use a cursor to print out the data from the result set of a SELECT statement.

create or replace PROCEDURE table_print(p_char VARCHAR2) is
  CURSOR curs1 IS 
  select owner, table_name from dba_tables
  where upper(table_name) like upper(p_char)||'%';
  rec curs1%ROWTYPE;
BEGIN
  OPEN curs1;
  LOOP
    FETCH curs1 INTO rec;
    EXIT WHEN curs1%NOTFOUND;
    dbms_output.put_line(rec.owner||' - '||rec.table_name);
  END LOOP;
  CLOSE curs1;
END;
